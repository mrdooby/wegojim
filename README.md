<h4 align="center">A Pokémon trainer's tool to beat the Elite Four.</h4>

## Motivation and Story
Have you ever been kicked out of your house by your mom and forced to go to a crazy scientist's lab across the street? Well that is how most children in the Hoenn Region were exposed to the outside world.

This project aims to keep these young trainers accountable for their Pokémons' training programs and make sure they are not losing all of their money to other random bloodthirsty trainers.

## Instructions for how to deploy the webpage:

Fork this repo into your local machine and do the following.

Create a .env file and add the following keys and values. Your .env file should end up looking something like this:  
  
PORT="3000"  

-<b>NOTE don’t include the apostrophes</b>

After finishing your .env file and saving it, you can now ```npm install``` in the root directory.

Once that finishes you can run ```npm run server-dev``` which should start up the server and also webpack.   
  
Navigate in your browser to localhost:(PORT_THAT_YOU_CHOSE_HERE) and you should see the webpage!
